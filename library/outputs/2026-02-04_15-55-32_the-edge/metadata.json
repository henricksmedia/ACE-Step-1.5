  "lyrics": "[INTRO]\nI can feel it pulling\nbefore I see it\n\n[VERSE 1]\nI’ve been running on a curve of light\nlike the ground might fall away\nEvery step gets louder\nthe closer I get to the edge\n\nI didn’t come for answers\nI just needed room to breathe\nThe sky keeps opening\nlike it’s daring me\n\n[PRE-CHORUS]\nMy heart keeps counting seconds\nthat my mouth won’t say\n\n[CHORUS]\nI’m racing to the edge of the planet\nnot to jump, just to know\nIf I stop at the line or keep going\nwhen there’s nowhere left to go\n\nI want to feel the ground give up\nbefore I do\n\n[VERSE 2]\nI’ve been carrying this gravity\nlike it knows my name\nEvery memory gets heavier\nthe faster I move away\n\nI look back once\nthen I don’t\nbecause I know what I’ll see\n\n[BREAK]\nWind in my chest\nHands shaking\nStill moving\n\n[FINAL CHORUS]\nI’m racing to the edge of the planet\nwith everything I couldn’t say\nIf I disappear over the horizon\nat least I chose the way\n\nI don’t need to be saved\nI just need to arrive\n\n[OUTRO]\nThe edge is closer now\nI don’t slow down",
