  "lyrics": "[Verse 1]  \nGrab your gear, sky's on fire,  \nBlast through madness, fuel the desire.  \nHues explode, barriers shatter,  \nGate crashes wide, no time to chatter.  \n\n[Build]  \nRhythm ramps, slots click tight,  \nOff-kilter thumps, ignite the fight.  \nSurge hits deep, subs rumble fierce,  \nTurn it loud, pierce the pierce.  \n\n[Chorus]  \nTrip around the world,  \nTrip around the world,  \nTrip around the world,  \nWorld, world, world!  \n\n[Drop]  \nBass pounds raw, groove gets warped,  \nHead-spinning surge, get absorbed.  \nRealms collide, plot twists wild,  \nEndless haul, style undefiled.  \n\n[Verse 2]  \nScale the highs, plunge the deeps,  \nFlames ignite, the craving creeps.  \nVintage pounds, bolts from above,  \nRouse the squad, shove comes to shove.  \n\n[Build]  \nTemp spikes, blasts break free,  \nRagged pulses, crank the spree.  \nRush builds strong, primed to explode,  \nBust the roof, reload the mode.  \n\n[Chorus]  \nTrip around the world,  \nTrip around the world,  \nTrip around the world,  \nWorld, world, world!  \n\n[Outro]  \nEase off gradual, path blurs away,  \nVibe hangs tough, here to stay.  \nWorld, world, world...  \nPush on forever, own the fray.",
